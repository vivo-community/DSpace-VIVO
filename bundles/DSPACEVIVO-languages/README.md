VIVO-languages
===============

Files required for displaying the VIVO user interface in different natural
languages, including American English.

Available language files
------------------------

At present, VIVO has been translated into American English (en_US),
Canadian English (en_CA), Canadian French (fr_CA), German (de_DE),
Spanish (es), and Brazilian Portuguese (pt_BR). Each available
language has its own top-level directory in this repository.

Using the language files
------------------------

If a directory for a language you want to use already exists here, you can
enable this language in your VIVO instance by following the instructions in the
VIVO wiki for [Adding a language to VIVO][1].

If a directory for your desired language does not exist, you may copy one of
the existing directories in this repository to use as a starting point for
doing the translations yourself. Rename your new directory using the appropriate
language code [prefix][2], and also rename the files within the various
levels of subdirectories to end with the appropriate code. Please send a note
to [the VIVO Tech group][3] to find out if someone else is already working on a
translation.  Additional information about developing a new translation is
available on the wiki at [Developing a New Interface Language for VIVO][4].

If you create a translation, please consider contributing your language files to
the VIVO community.
